                and become Pro at following rules</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
        <p>Before you jump into the world of solitaire, you must understand that solitaire follows a set of rules.</p>
        <p>If you want to be successful when playing solitaire, you must know about all the rules and master them as
            well. Following the rules, you will be able to make calculated moves.</p>

                Aces and Deuces</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
        <p>When playing a solitaire game, you must focus on keeping the aces and deuces to the foundation piles as soon
            as possible.</p>
        <p>In solitaire, the said card games can stir a lot of trouble for you, so you will want to make sure to get rid
            of these cards as soon as possible as they don’t even allow you to make any sequences!</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-ensure-to-follow-the-proper-order-of-cards"><span class="ez-toc-section"

            </strong><strong>Ensure to follow the proper order of cards</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>
        </h3>
        <p>As a solitaire player, you must know that there are some requirements for making some moves.</p>
        <p>The foundations in the game are built from aces to kinds, depending on the suit. At the same time, sequences
            will be created from kings to aces. As a player, you must alternate the cards of different colors.</p>
        <p>Doing so will allow you to have a strong position in the game.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-know-that-the-cards-present-in-the-foundations-are-immovable"><span
                class="ez-toc-section"

            </strong><strong>Know that the cards present in the foundations are immovable</strong><span
                class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
        <p>Once you end up placing a card in the foundation, the card becomes locked in a way. You will not be able to
            move the card again. The foundations are the vacant positions available in the top right corner, which are
            not possible to move.</p>
        <p>Having said that, you must be careful before placing any card in this position. You must keep in mind that
            there is no possible way for you to make a reversal after performing this move.</p>

                    rel="noreferrer noopener">game</a>.</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
        <p>Many novices make this rookie mistake. However, if you keep moving the cards without reason, you will find
            trouble finding breathing room.</p>
        <p>Having said that, you must not move the cards without having any specific aim in the picture. Your main
            objective must be simple. You must aim to place all the cards in the foundation.</p>
        <p>If you don’t follow this small trick, it’s going to become a little troublesome for you to chalk up a victory
            in the game of solitaire.</p>

        <p>If you want to be the best solitaire player that there is, then you must understand this crucial thing about
            the game.</p>
        <p>The best solitaire game is the one in which you have the least moves, and you have the highest possible
            score. Having said that, you must hold and avoid making any moves that don’t add any value to your game.</p>
        <p>This way, you will have moves to make in difficult situations as well!</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-try-to-develop-your-foundation-very-cleverly"><span class="ez-toc-section"

            </strong><strong>Try to develop your foundation very cleverly.</strong><span
                class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
        <p>Since we are mentioning the most important tips, let us give you a fact check. You must know that it is not
            possible for you to develop foundations at the game’s early stages.</p>
        <p>However, there is some good news to it as well. As a player, you must not hesitate to leave some cards just
            rest in the stockpile. This is so because these cards can later help you in moving the cards when you are
            stuck.</p>

            </strong><strong>Play kinds only when you stand to benefit from playing them</strong><span
                class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
        <p>This is an essential rule of the game that you must know. If you have a vacant cell, you can only fill it
            using a kind.</p>
        <p>You must move these cards as moving them creates a favorable situation for you. So, you must make sure that
            you observe the game closely before you go ahead and carry a card.</p>
        <p>This move is a risky one as it can make or break the game for you.</p>
