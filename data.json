</strong><strong>Know and become Pro at following rules</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you jump into the world of solitaire, you must understand that solitaire follows a set of rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be successful when playing solitaire, you must know about all the rules and master them as well. Following the rules, you will be able to make calculated moves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-keep-moving-aces-and-deuces\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Keep_Moving_Aces_and_Deuces\"></span><a></a><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Keep Moving Aces and Deuces</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing a solitaire game, you must focus on keeping the aces and deuces to the foundation piles as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In solitaire, the said card games can stir a lot of trouble for you, so you will want to make sure to get rid of these cards as soon as possible as they don’t even allow you to make any sequences!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-ensure-to-follow-the-proper-order-of-cards\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Ensure_to_follow_the_proper_order_of_cards\"></span><a></a><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Ensure to follow the proper order of cards</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a solitaire player, you must know that there are some requirements for making some moves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundations in the game are built from aces to kinds, depending on the suit. At the same time, sequences will be created from kings to aces. As a player, you must alternate the cards of different colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing so will allow you to have a strong position in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-know-that-the-cards-present-in-the-foundations-are-immovable\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Know_that_the_cards_present_in_the_foundations_are_immovable\"></span><a></a><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Know that the cards present in the foundations are immovable</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you end up placing a card in the foundation, the card becomes locked in a way. You will not be able to move the card again. The foundations are the vacant positions available in the top right corner, which are not possible to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, you must be careful before placing any card in this position. You must keep in mind that there is no possible way for you to make a reversal after performing this move.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-keep-your-eyes-focused-on-the-goal-of-the-game\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Keep_your_eyes_focused_on_the_goal_of_the_game\"></span><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep your eyes focused on the goal of the <a href=\"https://writingley.com/category/gaming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">game</a>.</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many novices make this rookie mistake. However, if you keep moving the cards without reason, you will find trouble finding breathing room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, you must not move the cards without having any specific aim in the picture. Your main objective must be simple. You must aim to place all the cards in the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t follow this small trick, it’s going to become a little troublesome for you to chalk up a victory in the game of solitaire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-try-to-win-the-highest-possible-point\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Try_to_win_the_highest_possible_point\"></span><a></a><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Try to win the highest possible point.</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be the best solitaire player that there is, then you must understand this crucial thing about the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best solitaire game is the one in which you have the least moves, and you have the highest possible score. Having said that, you must hold and avoid making any moves that don’t add any value to your game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you will have moves to make in difficult situations as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-7-try-to-develop-your-foundation-very-cleverly\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Try_to_develop_your_foundation_very_cleverly\"></span><a></a><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Try to develop your foundation very cleverly.</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we are mentioning the most important tips, let us give you a fact check. You must know that it is not possible for you to develop foundations at the game’s early stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is some good news to it as well. As a player, you must not hesitate to leave some cards just rest in the stockpile. This is so because these cards can later help you in moving the cards when you are stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-8-play-kinds-only-when-you-stand-to-benefit-from-playing-them\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Play_kinds_only_when_you_stand_to_benefit_from_playing_them\"></span><a></a><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Play kinds only when you stand to benefit from playing them</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an essential rule of the game that you must know. If you have a vacant cell, you can only fill it using a kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must move these cards as moving them creates a favorable situation for you. So, you must make sure that you observe the game closely before you go ahead and carry a card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This move is a risky one as it can make or break the game for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Final_Words\"></span><a></a><strong>Final Words</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here go the best eight tips and tricks that you must follow to win in solitaire. Following these tips and tricks, we are sure that you will win any solitaire game, regardless of how hard tricky the game is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must go ahead and try out these tips and tricks right away. We know you will be overwhelmed by the excitement that follows from winning a solitaire game!</p>\n",
